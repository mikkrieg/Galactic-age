## Description
This is a program that calculates a users age, life expectancy, years left to live and years dead on different planets. A user inputs their age and avg life expectancy. The program takes these values and creates user objects. There are four prototypes: mercury, venus, mars and jupiter. These take in the age and life expectancy that is present in a user object and reassign the age and life expectancy. As a bonus the program also calculates how many mayfly lifetimes a user has lived based on their planetary age. Then this number is compared the age of the sun to display a percentage.
